## How to play

You control a rabbit. Move around with WASD or the arrow keys. Avoid wolves
approching you and eat carrots to stay healthy! The wheel beside the rabbit is your
stamina/hunger. Running out of hearts or hunger leads to a loss. Eating carrots
will replenish hearts and hunger.

The goal is to find the maze exit. Have fun!
